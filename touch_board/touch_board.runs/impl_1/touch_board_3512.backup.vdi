WARNING: [Netlist 29-101] Netlist 'touch_board' is not ideal for floorplanning, since the cellview 'vga_display' contains a large number of primitives.  Please consider enabling hierarchy in synthesis if you want to do floorplanning.

WARNING: [Opt 31-35] Removing redundant IBUF, div/inst/clkin1_ibufg, from the path connected to top-level port: clk 
Resolution: The tool has removed redundant IBUF. To resolve this warning, check for redundant IBUF in the input design.
WARNING: [Constraints 18-550] Could not create 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' constraint because net 'div/clk_in1' is not directly connected to top level port. 'IBUF_LOW_PWR' is ignored by Vivado but preserved for implementation tool. [C:/Users/thb20/Desktop/Big_homework/touch_board/touch_board.runs/impl_1/.Xil/Vivado-3512-thb/dcp_2/clk_wiz_0.edf:296]
